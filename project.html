            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> 
                There has been significant improvement in girls' primary education worldwide since 2000. Morocco has shown the most dramatic improvement, while Chad is the poorest performer. However, most countries are improving, as the chart below shows.
            </p>
        </div>
        <figure id="Location1"></figure> 
        <p>
            Note that in the chart above, the rate is calculated as the number of entrants into the last year of primary education over the population of children at the entrance age for the last year of primary education; this returns some values above 100% where there are children starting the school year at a younger or older age.
        </p>
         <p> 
            Within this globally positive picture, however, there are some countries trending backwards. The worst of these are shown below, with the top improvers for reference.
            </p>
        </div>
        <figure id="Location2"></figure> 
        <p> 
            This perspective is incomplete, as countries in conflict - likely experiencing significant educational disruption - stop reporting. There is no data for Yemen since 2016, for Sudan since 2019, or for Ukraine since 2021, to take just a few examples. For more information, see Colab analysis and results here.
