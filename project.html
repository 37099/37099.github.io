            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In 2017, a man named Tommy Arthur was executed in Alabama on his 8th scheduled execution date. The previous seven, stretching back to 2001, had been stayed on the basis of the flimsy evidence against him and myriad concerns around the cocktail of drugs that would be used to kill him. I worked on his case, and it became increasingly obvious to me that lethal injection as it is currently administered in the United States is both cruel and unusual.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my project, I set out to research the history of capital punishment in the U.S. to validate or challenge my perspective. The central question is whether each successive innovation actually reduced suffering as intended, or merely created an illusion of more humanity. Through interactive visualizations of botched execution rates, time-to-death data, and geographic adoption patterns, the project challenges the narrative of progress in capital punishment and reveals how newer methods often fail more frequently than those they replaced.

                    <p>
              The topic is well-documented, and this project owes enormous credit to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), which maintains an excellent database of all executions going back to 1608. The project combines two primary sources: the Espy File (1608-2002) and the DPIC's modern execution database (1976-2025). Botched execution data was obtained through web scraping DPIC's public table using BeautifulSoup in Python, with reproducible code documented in Google Colab. Data sources are version-controlled in GitHub and charts are regenerated manually from Colab notebooks on an annual basis to capture new data. While not fully automated, this workflow ensures data quality review before publication and maintains full reproducibility through documented notebooks.
