            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> 
                From a global perspective, girls education has steadily improved worldwide since 2000.

            Note that in the chart above, the data do not account for students who drop out during the final year of primary education. Therefore, this rate serves as a proxy and should be considered an upper estimate of the actual primary completion rate. The rate is calculated as the number of entrants into the last year of primary education over the population of children at the entrance age for the last year of primary education; this returns some values about 100% where there are children starting the school year at a younger or older age.
