            <p>
                This project aims to i) visualize the development of different methods of capital punishment in the United States, and ii) assess the performance of lethal injection against its precursors and the claims of its proponents.

            <h2>A Historical Perspective</h2>
            <p>
                The history of capital punishment in the U.S. spans four key eras: hanging, which predominated from colonial days through the early 20th century; the electric chair; the de facto ban in the mid 1970s following Furman v. Georgia, which ruled that existing death penalty statutes were unconstitutioanl; and the modern era beginning with Gregg v Georgia (which effectively reinstated the death penalty), which has been dominated by lethal injection. My Colab analysis for both of the following charts is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SX7xM5HU0rMCM3RIfiiiQGTnGCSdAR2f?usp=sharing">here</a>.

            However, method use varies significantly by state, as the chart below shows. </p>

            <h2>A note on the inspiration</h2>
                    <p>
              In 2017, a man named Tommy Arthur was executed in Alabama on his 8th scheduled execution date. The previous seven, stretching back to 2001, had been stayed on the basis of uncertain evidence against him and myriad concerns around the cocktail of drugs that would be used to kill him. I worked on his case, and it became increasingly obvious to me that lethal injection as it is currently administered in the United States is both cruel and unusual. You can read more about Tommy's case <a href="https://eji.org/news/alabama-executes-75-year-old-tommy-arthur/">here</a>.
