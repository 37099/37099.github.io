            <h2>CC1: Hosting - loading a basic chart</h2>
            <p> 
                This week served as an introduction. We learned to load premade charts. Two examples follow.

            <h2>CC2: Building - creating visualizations from templates</h2>
            <p> 
                This week we created our own charts from pre-existing templates, using Vega-Lite and pulling data from the Economics Observatory Data Hub. My charts are below.

            <p> 
                The relationship between wealth and wellbeing is not linear, at an individual level or a societal one. Take a look at Kenya, where improvements in income supported steady increase in longevity until the early 1980s...

            <p> 
                I found the following (abysmal) chart in news reporting on Florida gun deaths from 2014.

                I replicated it using Vega-Lite:
            </p>
        </div>
        <figure id="Location8"></figure> 
        <p> 
                And then endeavored to improve it by correcting the orientation of the y axis, simplifying the x axis, removing decorative fill and widening the chart for easier reading:
