            <p> 
                This week served as an introduction. We learned to load premade charts. Two examples follow.

            <h2>CC2: Building - creating visualizations from templates</h2>
            <p> 
                This week we created our own charts from pre-existing templates, using Vega-Lite and pulling data from the Economics Observatory Data Hub. My charts are below.

                There relationship between wealth and wellbeing is not linear, at an individual level or a societal one. Take a look at Kenya, where improvements in income supported steady increase in longevity until the late 1980s.
